I listened to the director's commentary and (fun fact), for scenes that took place in the music store, they actually organized all the posters in the background to make it look more like the original comic. It's these tiny details that make the movie great.",

It has all the things i want for a movie: Action, Comedy, Romance and it's all blended together perfectly with no absolute miscalculations. To this day it still blows my mind of how perfect the casting is, but everyone had mixed reactions from Cera. I think Cera is perfect for Pilgrim. I mean i can't really imagine anyone else playing this role.",
